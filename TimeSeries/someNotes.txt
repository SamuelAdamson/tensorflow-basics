Fixed Partitioning
    -- Splitting timeseries into training period, validation period, and test period
    -- Make sure that each period has numerous seasons
    -- Train and tune model on training period, validate with validation period
    -- Train model on combination of training and validation period, test model on testing period
    -- Testing period is usually in the future

Roll-Forward Partitioning
    -- Start with small time periods, gradually increase
    -- Repeatedly train model in order to produce continually accurate results

Naive Forecasting
    -- Assuming that the next value at a given time interval will be the same as the previous value

Metrics for Time Series Forecasting
    -- Errors = forecasts - actual
    -- Mean Squared Error (MSE) = mean of errors^2
    -- Root Mean Squared Erorr (RMSE) = root of mean of errors^2
    -- Mean Absolute Error (MAE) = mean of abs(errors)
    -- Mean Absolute
